# Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) on Double-Helix Data  
### EM Algorithm Implemented From Scratch (NumPy Only)

This repository contains my MSc AI & ML assignment implementation of the  
Expectation–Maximisation (EM) algorithm **from scratch**, without using any canned libraries.

The dataset consists of 1,000 3D points arranged in a *double-helix structure*,  
representing people on a spiral staircase. The goal is to fit a **48-component**  
Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) where the initial means are placed directly  
on the two helices.
